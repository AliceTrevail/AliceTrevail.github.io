Alongside Liam Langley, Stephen Lang, & Luke Ozsanlav-Harris, we have created a toolkit for processing biologging data from tag downloads to online archive. Read the open access publication at Journal of Animal Ecology: [Langley et al 2024](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.14111). All resources and code can be accessed via the [ExMove website](https://exmove.github.io/) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ExMove/ExMove).

I am part of a team of Early Career Researchers promoting open and reproducible data science at the University of Exeter's penryn campus by delivering monthly workshops and talks, and sharing reproducible coding resources. Find upcoming and previous talks, alongside useful introductions and walkthroughs on common research programming activities, on the [ExeDataHub website](https://exeter-data-analytics.github.io/).
