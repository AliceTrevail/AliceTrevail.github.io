This ongoing project is part of the Bertarelli Programme in Marine Science.

**Aims:**

-   To understand the importance of the Chagos Archipelago Marine Protected Area for seabirds

-   To understand the causes and consequences of seabird connectivity across the Western Indian Ocean. In particular, the incidence and drivers of seabird prospecting, at-sea foraging habitat suitability, and the status of gene-flow among seabird colonies in the CA and WIO

### ExMove: An open-source toolkit for processing and exploring animal tracking data in R

Alongside Liam Langley, Stephen Lang, & Luke Ozsanlav-Harris, we have created a toolkit for processing biologging data from tag downloads to online archive. All resources and code can be accessed via the [ExMove website](https://exmove.github.io/) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ExMove/ExMove).

**Aims:**

-   Collate and process raw data from tracking devices, such as GPS, GLS and Argos, into a standardised data set for analyses and archiving in online tracking databases.

-   Facilitate robust data cleaning by providing an interactive shiny app to aid parameter determination and visualisation.

-   Generate a learning tool for users to develop skills in animal movement analysis.

-   Maximize stability by using a few well-maintained core R packages, including here, tidyverse and sf.

-   Provide open source code, the initial steps of which can be adapted for biologging studies, such as merging and standardizing additional sensor data (e.g., immersion/TDR) from multiple individuals.

I explored the influence of environmental heterogeneity, as a proxy for resource patchiness, on black-legged kittiwake, *Rissa tridactyla*, habitat selection, individual consistency, and reproductive success, during my PhD at the University of Liverpool.

**Key findings:**

-   Environmental heterogeneity most likely clusters resources into discrete patches. This provides foraging opportunity, creates competition among individuals with negative consequences for reproductive success and promotes individual specialisation in habitat selection.

-   Contributed to review of optimising biologging methods

I joined the Norwegian Polar Institute on expeditions to the Antarctic ([Tor field station](https://www.npolar.no/en/tor/)) and Arctic (Svalbard) to help with regular seabird monitoring, and foraging ecology studies.

**Key findings:**

-   Prey density effects predator foraging strategies, most likely via group vigilance and defense

-   Individual foraging strategy is linked to diet in Antarctic petrels, with implications for population resiliance to climate change and fishery impacts

Monitoring plastic ingestion by northern fulmars, *Fulmaris glacialis*, in the Norwegian high Arctic, during my MSci at the University of Southampton.

**Key findings:**

-   Arctic marine litter levels were higher than expected from regional trends, and exceeded the ecological quality objective defined by OSPAR for European seas.

-   Highlighted the value of seabirds as bio-indicator species within marine policy, the connectivity of the global oceans, and the need for urgent regulation of plastic pollution in the Arctic

-   Contributed to ongoing monitoring and recommendation of standardised methods for quantifying debris ingestion in marine megafauna
