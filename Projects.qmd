##### Postdoctoral Research Associate, University of Exeter, 2019 - present

This ongoing project is part of the Bertarelli Programme in Marine Science.

**Aims:**

-   To understand the importance of the Chagos Archipelago Marine Protected Area for seabirds

-   To understand the causes and consequences of seabird connectivity across the Western Indian Ocean. In particular, the incidence and drivers of seabird prospecting, at-sea foraging habitat suitability, and the status of gene-flow among seabird colonies in the CA and WIO

##### PhD, University of Liverpool, 2015 - 2019

I explored the influence of environmental heterogeneity, as a proxy for resource patchiness, on black-legged kittiwake, *Rissa tridactyla*, habitat selection, individual consistency, and reproductive success.

**Key findings:**

-   Environmental heterogeneity most likely clusters resources into discrete patches. This provides foraging opportunity, creates competition among individuals with negative consequences for reproductive success and promotes individual specialisation in habitat selection.

-   Contributed to studies of Antarctic seabird foraging ecology

-   Contributed to review of optimising biologging methods

##### MSci, University of Southampton & University in Svalbard, 2010 - 2014

Monitoring plastic ingestion by northern fulmars, *Fulmaris glacialis*, in the Norwegian high Arctic

**Key findings:**

-   Arctic marine litter levels were higher than expected from regional trends, and exceeded the ecological quality objective defined by OSPAR for European seas.

-   Highlighted the value of seabirds as bio-indicator species within marine policy, the connectivity of the global oceans, and the need for urgent regulation of plastic pollution in the Arctic

-   Contributed to ongoing monitoring and recommendation of standardised methods for quantifying debris ingestion in marine megafauna
